how to use or generate own ssl certificate this is to learn only because your browser will not allow your certificate so you will have to use or issue certificate from your hosting provider

go to  if linux or mac then already installed
1 > openssl windows
2 > Binaries - OpenSSLWiki
3 > OpenSSL for Windows -> https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
4 > Win64 Win64 OpenSSL v3.0.5 Light
    EXE | MSI

after installation add this path into environment variable
C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin her put \bin at the end of path

to check is it installed or not use this command in cod
>openssl version -a

//to genrate sertificate
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IN
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Gujrat
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Surat
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:mine
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Education
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:localhost or domain name
Email Address []:sojitraurvish0@gmail.com

now it will generate two thing private key and sertificate(public key) and it serve to client 
then client encrypt data with this sertificate and send back to server and server will decrypt data with pivate key
